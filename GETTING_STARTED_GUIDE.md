### 4. User Interaction
Users can:
- **Minimize/Maximize**: Click the minimize icon to collapse the modal to just the header (guide stays visible but takes minimal space)
- **Expand/Collapse sections**: Click on section headers to view steps
- **Mark steps as complete**: Click the checkbox next to each step
- **Navigate to features**: Click action buttons to go directly to relevant pages
- **Track progress**: See completion percentage in the progress bar

**Note**: The guide cannot be dismissed - it remains available until all tasks are completed, encouraging users to complete their setup.
